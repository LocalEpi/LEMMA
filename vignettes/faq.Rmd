## How do the Re multipliers for interventions work?

The first Re multiplier is multiplied by the basic R0 to give the new Re after the first intervention.
The second Re multiplier is multiplied by the basic R0 **and** the first Re multiplier to give the new Re after the second intervention.

Re after third intervention = `R0 * intervention1.multiplier * intervention2.multiplier * intervention3.multiplier`

## How many interventions can I have?

You can have any number of interventions. If you want more, just add rows using the same format.
