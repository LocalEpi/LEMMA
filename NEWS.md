v0.3.0.9004 

“Best Guess” was sometimes misinterpreted so we changed “Best Guess” to “User’s Prior Projection”. User’s Prior Projection is only displayed if niter < 100.

Added to internal.args:
- plot.observed.data.long.term
- plot.observed.data.short.term
- lower.bound.label
- upper.bound.label

PDF now includes short-term (dates of observed data) and long-term (until Projection End Date) plots
